Introduction
============
SlotsOPS is an online software to monitor availability of the PPR at Geneva international airport in Switzerland (LSGG/GVA).
This tool is currently only able to inform you about any available slot taht meets your criterias. Slots cannot be booked directly from this system. You still need to contact your FBO of choice to book the available PPR.

Once a slot becomes available it is notified to the clients that requested it on a first-come-first-served basis. Meaning the oldest requests will take priority over the newest.
We only notify as many clients as slots are available. For more details on how the notification system works please visit our Features Guide.

We believe in fairness and transparency, therefore we do not and will not offer special or premium accounts able to override our queueing system.
